EDUCATIONAL QUIZ APPLICATION
Overview
The Educational Quiz Application is an interactive and user-friendly Python-based quiz platform designed to educate users while making learning fun and engaging. It supports multiple categories, allowing users to test their knowledge on diverse topics such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Science, and History. This project aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) by promoting quality education (SDG 4) through accessible and interactive learning.

KEY FEATURES
Category Selection: Users can choose from different quiz categories (e.g., SDGs, Science, History) to tailor their learning experience.
Multiple-Choice Questions: Each category contains a set of multiple-choice questions, making it easy for users to engage and participate.
Randomized Questions: Questions are shuffled to ensure variety and prevent repetition, providing a fresh experience every time the quiz is taken.
Real-Time Feedback: Users receive instant feedback on whether their answers are correct or incorrect, along with the correct answer if they choose incorrectly.
Score Tracking: At the end of the quiz, users can see their total score and gauge their knowledge of the selected category.


HOW IT WORKS
Upon starting the application, users are greeted with a welcome message and prompted to choose a quiz category.
The selected category's questions are presented one at a time with four multiple-choice options.
Users answer questions by typing the number corresponding to their chosen option.
After each question, users receive feedback and their answers are evaluated.
At the end of the quiz, the total score is displayed, showing the number of correct answers out of the total questions.


TECHNOLOGY STACK
Programming Language: Python
Development Environment: Any Python-supported text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PyCharm, IDLE).


FEATURES IN DETAIL CATEGORIES
The application currently supports the following categories:


SDG (Sustainable Development Goals):
Focuses on educating users about the 17 SDGs, with questions on topics like poverty, education, and climate action.
Science:
Covers general knowledge questions related to scientific concepts, space, and chemistry.
History:

FEEDBACK SYSTEM
For every question, users are informed whether their answer is correct or incorrect.
